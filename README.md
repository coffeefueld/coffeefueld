Hello there, Im @coffeefueld

I'm an amateur programmer fascinated by the accomplishments the software world has achieved.
I'm currently a student for a computer science degree.
I really like learning about Unix-like operating systems and how to unlock full hardware potential.
I don't really think im going to use this profile for much stuff since im not knee deep into this world yet but one day!

Peace!
